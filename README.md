# Ad-Click-Prediction
This repository contains code for a Data Analytics project that predicts whether a user is likely to click on a particular ad based on various features.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a user will click on an ad or not. By analyzing user demographics and behavior, the model aims to provide valuable insights for advertisers to optimize their ad targeting strategies.

# Dataset
It contains information such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, ad topic line, city, gender, country, timestamp, and whether the user clicked on the ad or not.

# Implementation
The project implementation involves the following steps:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Handling missing values, if any, and performing data cleaning.
Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing the relationships between different features.
Visualizing patterns and trends in the data using plots and graphs.
Model Development:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implementing machine learning models such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, and decision trees.
Training the models on the training data and evaluating their performance on the testing data.
Model Evaluation:

Assessing the accuracy of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Comparing the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one for the task.

# Usage
